## Fundamentals

**Creating and initializing an array.** Making an array in a Java program involves three distinct steps: 
* Declare the array name and type.
* Create the array. 
* Initialize the array values.

**Aliasing.** Note carefully that an array name refers to the whole arrayâ€”if we assign one array name to another, then both refer to the same array, as illustrated in the following code fragment.

If your intent is to make a copy of an array, then you need to declare, create, and initialize a new array and then copy all of the entries in the original array to the new array.

**Invoking a static method.** A method call followed by a semicolon is a statement that generally causes side effects. For example, the call Arrays.sort() in main() in BinarySearch is a call on the system method Arrays.sort() that has the side effect of putting the entries in the array in sorted order. When a method is called, its argument variables are initialized with the values of the corresponding expressions in the call. A return statement terminates a static method, returning control to the caller. If the static method is to compute a value, that value must be specified in a return statement (if such a static method can reach the end of its sequence of statements without a return, the compiler will report the error).
